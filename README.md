# text-localization-agent

The code to train the agent.

## Prerequisites

You need Python 3 (preferably 3.6) installed, as well as the requirements from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

Furthermore, you need to install the [text-localization-environment](https://github.com/hpi-www-midl-text-localization/text-localization-environment) by following its **Installation** instructions.

## Usage

Training an agent requires two files:

1. A textfile where each line contains the path to one image in the training dataset
2. A numpy file (.npy) that contains the bounding boxes associated with each image. For n images this file contains a list with n entries where each entry is a list of bounding boxes in the format ((x<sub>topleft</sub>, y<sub>topleft</sub>), (x<sub>bottomright</sub>, y<sub>bottomright</sub>))

Datasets generated by the [dataset generator](https://github.com/hpi-www-midl-text-localization/dataset-generator) fullfill these requirements. With these two files you can start training by starting the train_agent.py script. Here is an overview of the available options:

You need to specify a config file similar to the `example.ini` the following way: `python3 train_agent.py --config config.ini`

Overview of executable python scripts:
|File|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`iou.py`| Measures the IoUs of an agent for 100 epsiodes|
|`train_agent.py`|Train the agent|
|`visualize_agent_graph.py`| Creates a .dot file of the computational graph of the agent|
|`visualize_agent.py`| Creates an image sequnce of maximum 15 steps of an episode|

## TensorBoard

If you would like the program to generate log-files appropriate for visualization in TensorBoard, you need to:

* Install **tensorflow**
  ```bash
  $ pip install tensorflow
  ```
  (If you use Python 3.7 and the installation fails, use: `pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.12.0-py3-none-any.whl
` instead. [See here, why.](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/20444#issuecomment-442767411))
* Run the *text-localization-agent* program with the `--tensorboard` flag
   ```bash
   $ python train-agent.py --tensorboard --imagefile … --boxfile …
   ``` 
* Start TensorBoard pointing to the `tensorboard/` directory inside the *text-localization-agent* project
   ```bash
   $ tensorboard --logdir=<path to text-localization-agent>/tensorboard/
   …
   TensorBoard 1.12.0 at <link to TensorBoard UI> (Press CTRL+C to quit)
   ``` 
* Open the TensorBoard UI via the link that is provided when the `tensorboard` program is started (usually: http://localhost:6006)

## Training on the chair's servers

To run the training on one of the chair's servers you need to:

* Clone the necessary repositories
* Create a new virtual environment. Note that the Python version needs to be at least 3.6 for everything to run. 
The default might be a lower version so if that is the case you must make sure that the correct version is used.
You can pass the correct python version to virtualenv via the `-p` parameter, for example
    ```bash
    $ virtualenv -p python3.6 <envname>
    ```
    (If there is no Python 3.6/3.7 installed you are out of luck because we don't have sudo access)
* Activate the environment via
    ```bash
    $ source <envname>/bin/activate
    ```
* Install the required packages (see section "Prerequisites"). Don't forget **cupy**, **tb_chainer** and **tensorflow**!
* Prepare the training data (either generate it using the [dataset-generator](https://github.com/hpi-www-midl-text-localization/dataset-generator)
or transfer existing data on the server)
* To avoid stopping the training after disconnecting from the server, you might want to use a terminal-multiplexer 
such as [tmux](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/tmux/) or [screen](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Screen/)
* Set the CUDA_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables if they are not already set. The command should be something like
    ```bash
    $ export CUDA_PATH=/usr/local/cuda
    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_PATH/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```
* To download the ResNet-50 caffemodel (it isn't downloaded automatically) see [link](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21AAFW2-FVoxeVRck&id=4006CBB8476FF777%2117887&cid=4006CBB8476FF777) and save it where necessary (an error will tell you where if you try to create a TextLocEnv).
* Start training!

These instructions are for starting from scratch, for example if there is already a suitable virtual environment you 
obviously don't need to create a new one.
